# ASP.NET Core Practice

## Disclaimer

This is a test project when learning of ASP.NET Core. The XML comments have simple description. If you have any questions about the content, then implementing the project and using <a href="https://www.postman.com" target="_blank">Postman</a> or <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler" target="_blank">Fiddler</a> to understand the test results will help you learn. A few examples make the browser a better choice.
